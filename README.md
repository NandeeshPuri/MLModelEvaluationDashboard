# MLModelEvaluationDashboard

A comprehensive dashboard for training, evaluating, and comparing multiple machine learning classification models with hyperparameter tuning.
Project Overview
This project enables data scientists to train and compare multiple machine learning models on classification tasks. It provides an interactive dashboard to visualize model performance across various metrics, helping to select the best model for specific use cases. The system includes data preprocessing, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and detailed performance visualization.
Key Features

Train and evaluate 5+ classification algorithms
Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
Interactive dashboard for model comparison
Comprehensive performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, R2)
Visual comparison of model performance before and after tuning

Pandas/NumPy: For data manipulation
Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory data analysis

Setup Instructions

Clone the repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-model-evaluation-dashboard.git
cd ml-model-evaluation-dashboard

Set up virtual environment
bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies
bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application
bashpython app.py
The dashboard will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your web browser.

How It Works
1. Data Preparation
The data_loader.py component handles dataset acquisition, cleaning, and splitting into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
2. Model Training
Five classification models are implemented:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine
Gradient Boosting

Each model is trained on the prepared dataset and evaluated.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization techniques are used to find optimal hyperparameters for each model, significantly improving performance.
4. Performance Evaluation
Models are evaluated using multiple metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
R2 score (where applicable)

5. Interactive Dashboard
The dashboard visualizes:

Performance metrics for all models
Comparison between baseline and tuned models
Feature importance for applicable models
Confusion matrices for classification results

Example Usage
python# Example code for using the trained models
from components.data_loader import load_data
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_data()

# Train a model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
